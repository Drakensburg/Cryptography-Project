# Cryptography-Project
The encryption and decryption program you seek is an all-inclusive solution that employs multiple encryption methods to safeguard your data. The program utilizes four encryption algorithms, namely the Vernam cipher, the Vigenere cipher, the Transposition cipher, and a custom-designed encryption method.<br />
### VERNAM
The Vernam cipher is a one-time pad encryption method that produces ciphertext using a randomly generated key of the same length as the plaintext. This method guarantees absolute privacy because the key is never used again.<br />
### VIGENERE
The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution algorithm that encrypts plaintext with a keyword. Each character in the plaintext is displaced by the letter that corresponds to the corresponding letter in the keyword.<br />
###TRANSPOSITION
The Transposition cipher is a permutation-based encryption algorithm that reorders the plaintext characters to create the ciphertext.<br />
### UNIQUE
The program also includes a one-of-a-kind encryption technique that incorporates the Caeser cipher and modulus funcvtions.<br />
### FINAL THOUGHTS
Depending on their inclination, users can encrypt and decrypt their data using any of the four available encryption methods. Users can select the desired encryption method, input their plaintext, and specify the encryption key. The program will then encrypt the plaintext using the chosen algorithm and produce the ciphertext.<br />
Likewise, the program enables users to decrypt their ciphertext using the same encryption method and key used to encrypt it. The program will then undo the encryption to produce the plaintext.<br />
In conclusion, the encryption and decryption program is a comprehensive data security solution that provides users with multiple encryption techniques. The program employs the Vernam, Vigenere, and Transposition ciphers as well as a unique form of encryption to provide a robust and secure method of encrypting your data.<br />
